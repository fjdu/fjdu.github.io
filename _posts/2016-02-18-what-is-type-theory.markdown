Ref:

<ol type="a">
    <li> Girard </li>
</ol>

<section>
<h1>  </h1>
<div>
<ol>
    <li> It is an abuse (and this is not cheap philosophy --- it is a concrete question) to say that \(27\times37\) equals 999, since if the two things we have were the same then we would never feel the need to state their equality. </li>
</ol>
</div>

</section>
